# AMIDST Toolbox Use Cases

This is a secondary repository to the [AMIDST toolbox repository](https://github.com/amidst/toolbox). This repository contains the code of relevant use-cases of the AMIDST Toolbox. I.e. those contributions do not add a specific functionality to the toolbox. They can be seen as examples of how this toolbox can be used. This category might include contributions related to student projects, research papers, industry applications, etc. The AMIDST core team will not supervise the quality of the contributions, this is responsibility of the contributors. They will be integrated as independent Maven modules. For futher information about how to contribute to AMIDST use the following [link](http://amidst.github.io/toolbox/ContributingToAMIDST.html).
