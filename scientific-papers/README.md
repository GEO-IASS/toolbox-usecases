1.  Hanen Borchani et. **Modeling concept drift: A probabilistic graphical model based approach**. Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2015). Saint-Etienne, France.

> An often used approach for detecting and adapting to con- cept drift when doing classification is to treat the data as i.i.d. and use changes in classification accuracy as an indication of concept drift. In this paper, we take a different perspective and propose a framework, based on probabilistic graphical models, that explicitly represents concept drift using latent variables. To ensure efficient inference and learning, we re- sort to a variational Bayes inference scheme. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate and analyze the proposed framework using synthetic data sets as well as a real financial data set from a Spanish bank.
